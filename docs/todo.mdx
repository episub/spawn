#  TODO

* Change string field names to a new type so we can explicitly require them
* Eliminate the two-step paginated query steps
* Remove files in cmd/static/gnorm if not used.  db.go is not, I think
* Replace Gnorm based where clauses with squirrel?  https://github.com/Masterminds/squirrel or https://github.com/doug-martin/ or https://github.com/ulule/loukoum
* Batched queries:
    * Don't have db as a parameter when it's not even used
    * Have a non-batched option that can be used for transactions
* Update all return values in `cmd/static/loader/gen.gotmpl`  to return sanitised errors
* Allow modification of all the template files, like with gnorm
* Instead of map, use a structural, with a string array naming the fields that are provided or to be updated, to allow us to distinguish between 'no change' vs 'null this field'.
* Obfuscate cursor in pagination
* Simplify the config so that some parts (ModelPackageShort) can be automatically calculated when not provided
* Consider a migration tool like goose, sql-migrate, mattes/migrate
