# Errors

When a GraphQL request has an error, we return these results formatted as part of the GraphQL JSON response.  These errors can be added using [gqlgen's build in method](https://gqlgen.com/reference/errors/).

# Validation

Spawn provides a validation library used to help validate values and add them as errors.  Most of the validation functions typically take as inputs parameters like:

* Context: Errors are added to the context if there are any such errors to report
* Field: The name of the field that has the error.  When using some of the auto-generated update and create code, a path is automatically added to the context so you can keep track of how deep you are in the chain, and get a full path.
* Value: Whatever value is needed to be checked
* Message: What error message you would like displayed in case of failure

For example, to ensure that a password meets minimum length requirements, you can call:

```
validate.MinimumLength(ctx, 8, password, "password")
```

If the password fails to meet this requirement, then an error such as the following will be returned as part of the mutation response:

```
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Must be at least 8 characters long",
      "path": [
        "registerUser"
      ],
      "extensions": {
        "field": "password"
      }
    }
  ],
  "data": {
    "registerUser": false
  }
}
```
